# `msp430fr2x5x-hal`

> A high-level Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the MSP430FR2355, MSP430FR2353, MSP430FR2153 and MSP430FR2155 microcontrollers.

This crate is primarily designed to be used as a dependency in another project, but the examples in the repo can be build and flashed directly to a device, provided the required dependencies are installed.

# Dependencies

To build the examples [`msp430-gcc`](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE) should be available on your PATH.

To flash an example [`mspdebug`](https://dlbeer.co.nz/mspdebug/) should also be available on your PATH.

# Usage

A number of examples are provided, targetting the MSP430FR2355 (typically the MSP-EXP430FR2355 dev board). They can be built with `cargo build --example <example_name> --features <device>` 

An example can be flashed to a connected device with `cargo run --example <example_name> --features <device>`

The default `memory.x` file can be used on any of the supported devices, but only makes use of 16kB FRAM / 2kB RAM. To use the extra space on 32kB models you can rename `memory_32k.x` to `memory.x` instead.

## Features

The device being targetted is defined by specifying exactly one device feature, such as `msp430fr2355`.

This crate provides an embedded-hal 1.0 implementation automatically, and an additional implementation of the legacy 0.2.7 version is available behind the `embedded-hal-02` feature.

# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate requires the `nightly` toolchain to compile, currently targetting `nightly-2022-03-01` (Rust 1.61) or later. It might compile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

# Assumptions

The HAL provides a maximal set of GPIO pins (targetting the package with the most pins). If you are using one of the variants with fewer pins then it is up to you to ensure that the GPIO pins you use are in fact available.
For example, on the 28-pin variant eUSCI_B1 only supports I2C due to missing pins. This is not checked in the HAL.
