//! I2C
//!
//! Peripherals eUSCI_B0 and eUSCI_B1 can be used for I2C communication.
//!
//! Begin by calling [`I2cConfig::new()`]. Depending on configuration, one of [`I2cSlave`] or [`I2cSingleMaster`]
//! will be returned.
//! 
//! [`I2cSlave`] acts as a slave device on the bus. If the MSP430 is to be the only master on the bus then [`I2cSingleMaster`] 
//! offers simplified error handling. If more than one master is on the bus then [`I2cMultiMaster`] should be used instead.
//!
//! In all modes interrupts can be set and cleared using the `set_interrupts()` and `clear_interrupts()` methods alongside
//! [`I2cInterruptFlags`], which provides a user-friendly way to set the register flags.
//! 
//! ## [`I2cSlave`]
//! In slave mode the peripheral responds to requests from master devices. The 'own address' is treated as 7-bit should a `u8`
//! be provided, and 10-bit if a `u16` is provided.
//! Both polling and interrupt-based methods are available, though interrupt-based is recommended for slave devices, as the slave
//! can 'fall behind' and lose information if polling is not done frequently enough.
//!
//! The interrupt-based interface relies on using [`interrupt_source()`](I2cRoleCommon::interrupt_source()) to determine which event
//! caused the interrupt. The polling-based implementation instead uses calls to [`poll()`](I2cRoleSlave::poll()) to listen for events.
//! In either case methods such as [`write_tx_buf()`](I2cSlave::write_tx_buf()) and
//! [`read_rx_buf()`](I2cSlave::read_rx_buf()) can be used to respond accordingly.
//!
//! ## [`I2cSingleMaster`]
//! Single master mode provides simplified error handling and ergonomics at the cost of being unsuitable for buses with more than one
//! master - single master mode does not handle bus arbitration, so even if the device is not expected to be addressed as a slave it is not
//! suitable for use on a multi-master bus.
//!
//! An easy-to-use blocking implementation is available through [`embedded_hal::i2c::I2c`], which provides methods for read, write,
//! write-read, and generic transactions. Additionally, slave detection is provided through [`is_slave_present()`](I2cRoleMaster::is_slave_present()).
//!
//! A non-blocking or interrupt-based implementation is possible using [`I2cSingleMaster::send_start()`],
//! [`write_tx_buf()`](I2cSingleMaster::write_tx_buf), [`read_rx_buf()`](I2cSingleMaster::read_rx_buf), and
//! [`schedule_stop()`](I2cRoleMaster::schedule_stop).
//! 
//! ## [`I2cMultiMaster`]
//! [`I2cMultiMaster`] acts similarly to [`I2cSingleMaster`], but with the addition of bus arbitration logic.
//! The MSP430 hardware automatically fails over from master to slave mode when arbitration is lost, so the methods check for this
//! before performing operations. After losing arbitration [`return_to_master()`](I2cRoleMulti::return_to_master) must be called.
//! 
//! ## [`I2cMasterSlave`]
//! [`I2cMasterSlave`] can act as either a master or slave device. It is multi-master capable by necessity.
//! It broadly combines the functionality of [`I2cSlave`] and [`I2cMultiMaster`], providing a blocking master implementation via
//! [`embedded_hal::i2c::I2c`], and a non-blocking or interrupt-based interface via methods similar to [`I2cMultiMaster`]:
//! [`I2cMasterSlave::send_start()`], [`write_tx_buf_as_master()`](I2cMasterSlave::write_tx_buf_as_master),
//! [`read_rx_buf_as_master()`](I2cMasterSlave::read_rx_buf_as_master), and [`schedule_stop()`](I2cRoleMaster::schedule_stop).
//!
//! The MSP430 hardware automatically fails over from master to slave mode when arbitration is lost or the device is addressed as a slave,
//! so the master-related methods check for this before attempting master-related operations, returning an error if so.
//! The device can be restored to master mode via [`return_to_master()`](I2cRoleMulti::return_to_master). If arbitration is lost this
//! method may be called immediately, however if the device is addressed as a slave then this slave transaction must be resolved
//! before the device can be returned to master mode.
//!
//! The slave interface is much the same as what is provided by [`I2cSlave`]: Bus events can be discovered using
//! [`interrupt_source()`](I2cRoleCommon::interrupt_source()) for an interrupt-based implementation, or [`poll()`](I2cRoleSlave::poll())
//! for a polling-based one. [`write_tx_buf_as_slave()`](I2cMasterSlave::write_tx_buf_as_slave) and
//! [`read_rx_buf_as_slave()`](I2cMasterSlave::read_rx_buf_as_slave) allow for writing to the Rx and Tx buffers. These methods don't have the
//! bus arbitration and slave addressing checks that the `_as_master` variants do, so these should only be called in slave mode.
//! 
//! Pins used:
//!
//! eUSCI_B0: {SCL: `P1.3`, SDA: `P1.2`}. `P1.1` can optionally be used as an external clock source in master modes.
//!
//! eUSCI_B1: {SCL: `P4.7`, SDA: `P4.6`}. `P4.5` can optionally be used as an external clock source in master modes.
