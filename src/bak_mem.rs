//! Backup Memory.
//! 32 bytes of memory that survive system resets. 
//! 
//! This memory is still volatile however, so it won't survive power loss. The backup memory is powered in all modes except LPM4.5.
//! 
//! The peripheral access crate exposes the backup memory as 16 individual 16-bit registers. 
//! This module provides helper functions for reinterpreting the backup memory as various array types.
//! 
//! After choosing the most convenient data type for your application call the relevant method, 
//! such as [`BackupMemory::as_u8s()`], to recieve a mutable reference to the backup memory.
