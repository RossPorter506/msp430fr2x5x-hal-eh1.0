//! Backup Memory.
//! 32 bytes of memory that survive system resets.
//!
//! This memory is still volatile however, so it won't survive power loss. The backup memory is powered in all modes except LPM4.5.
//!
//! The peripheral access crate exposes the backup memory as 16 individual 16-bit registers.
//! This module provides helper functions for reinterpreting the backup memory as various array types.
//!
//! After choosing the most convenient data type for your application call the relevant method,
//! such as [`BackupMemory::as_u8s()`], to recieve a mutable reference to the backup memory.
