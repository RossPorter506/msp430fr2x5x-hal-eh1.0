//! Low Power Mode (LPM) control
//!
//! The MSP430FR2x5x series supports several low power modes, namely LPM0, LPM3, LPM4, as well as LPM3.5 and LPM4.5.
//! # LPM0
//! LPM0 turns off the CPU, while the rest of the system continues unimpeded. Entering LPM0 has no special requirements.
//!
//! # LPM3
//! LPM3 turns off most high frequency clocks (FLL and DCO subsystems, MODCLK, etc.), most notably SMCLK.
//! Since most peripherals can be clocked by a low frequency clock source, this allows many peripherals to continue operating
//! at a reduced speed.
//!
//! LPM3 will only be entered if no peripherals have been configured to use SMCLK, otherwise LPM0 will be entered instead.
//!
//! GPIO pins will maintain the value they had when LPM3 was entered.
//!
//! # LPM4
//! LPM4 turns off all clock sources. The RTC or Watchdog peripherals can request very low power oscillators (VLOCLK or XTCLK)
//! if needed, though this will increase power consumption and is not considered 'true' LPM4. Some analog peripherals
//! (eCOMP, SAC) continue to function in LPM4. Wake-up events are limited to GPIO or RTC interrupts.
//!
//! LPM4 will only be entered if no peripherals have been configured to use SMCLK or ACLK. If any peripherals have requested SMCLK
//! then LPM0 will be entered, otherwise if any peripherals have requested ACLK then LPM3 will be entered.
//!
//! GPIO pins will maintain the value they had when LPM4 was entered.
//!
//! # LPM3.5
//! LPM3.5 is an extension of LPM4 that also disables the RAM and analog peripherals. Unlike in LPM4, the very low power
//! oscillators (VLOCLK or XTCLK) are expected to be used in LPM3.5.
//! Because the RAM is unpowered, all internal state is lost and when the MCU wakes up execution will restart from the beginning
//! of the program. The 32-byte region of Backup Memory is powered through LPM3.5, which can be used to maintain some state
//! between iterations.
//!
//! Unlike with LPM3 and 4, a peripheral requesting a high-speed clock source like SMCLK will not stop LPM3.5 from being entered.
//!
//! During LPM3.5 GPIO pins will maintain the value they had when LPM3.5 was entered but the register contents are lost, so after a wake-up
//! the GPIO pins will take on their reset values when LOCKLPM5 is cleared.
//!
//! # LPM4.5
//! LPM4.5 is an extension of LPM3.5 that also disables the very low power oscillators, backup memory, and RTC. Barely anything
//! is powered in this mode. The only methods to wake from LPM4.5 are a GPIO interrupt, the reset pin, or a power cycle.
//! Like LPM3.5, all internal state is lost and program execution restarts from the beginning when a wake-up occurs. Unlike LPM3.5,
//! the backup memory is unpowered, so can't be used to store state. The 512-byte section of non-volatile Information Memory can however
//! be used to store data while the MCU is in active mode, and can be read back after a wake-up event.
//!
//! Unlike with LPM3 and 4, a peripheral requesting a clock source like SMCLK or ACLK will not stop LPM4.5 from being entered.
//!
//! During LPM4.5 GPIO pins will maintain the value they had when LPM3.5 was entered but the register contents are lost, so after a wake-up
//! the GPIO pins will take on their reset values when LOCKLPM5 is cleared.
